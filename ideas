-Add a system to make nuke awhful to get, like a status (ideas) for every nuclear country so they dont get malus, and ai is discourage to attack a nuclear power
but add a big malus like threat, and relationship with every neighbour is lower if you search this and neighbour can get a wargoal to destroy your nuclear projet. 
You need to take time to develop nuclear. 
A major strike add effect to province like only 2 buildings slot, (+2 every year you recover until the original number of slots)

For civil war, add a lot of malus of move, to get a realistic conflicts like myanmar
